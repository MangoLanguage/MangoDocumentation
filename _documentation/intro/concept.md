# Basic concept

The language development had started many time ago from some small prototypes and ideas and had more edicational purpose. 
Since that, many things was weighted and deliberated. Some of them were thrown out, but some had a good development.

*Then, the following principles were set as primary for this language:*
- The main purpose of the language is development of any type of web-applications: from small websites to enterprise solutions
- The language should be structured, well-organized and easy to learn
- It should be fast and support reactive way for app development from the box
- It should support all major things from modern languages
- It should support OOP on a good level (including interfaces, traits, inheritance, static and access modifiers)
- Type handling should be strict and optionally static
- Syntax should be aesthetically beautiful for ending user (web-app developer)
- Core functionality should support all major things that are required in order to develop web applications.
- Core functionality should also to be implemented in way to do common things quick, within less lines of code and reusable way.
- The language should be compatible with NGINX web server
